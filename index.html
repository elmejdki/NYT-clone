        CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist 
        named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, 
        stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond 
        the world of known physics.<br/><br/>

        He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic 
        particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he 
        discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A 
        potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have 
        infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive 
        force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light 
        for a prodigiously violent instant.<br/><br/>

        If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens
        look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The 
        enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities.
        Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection,
        like spit in the ocean.<br/><br/>

        “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page 
        and drew a double box around it.<br/><br/>

        On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that
        they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
        known undramatically as inflation, looked right.<br/><br/>

        Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic 
        time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by 
        John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics 
        detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#">gravitational 
        waves</a> — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when 
        it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second 
        old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, 
        Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.<br/><br/>

        Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including 
        Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved. <br><br>

        If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to
        the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself.
        It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.<br><br>
        
        Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years
        in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger 
        cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there 
        might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water 
        boiling over.<br><br>

        In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond 
        the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s 
        ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s 
        theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.<br><br>

        Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, 
        said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”<br><br>

        He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in 
        gravitational waves.”<br><br>

        The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that 
        permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as 
        the surface of the sun.<br><br>

        Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of 
        Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for 
        Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.<br><br>

      <h3>The Theory of Inflation</h3>
      <p>Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation, 
        which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly 
        in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.</p>

        <span class="first graphic-desc">
          <strong>THE UNIVERSE</strong>
          is just under 14 billion years old. From our position in the Milky
           Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about 92 billion 
           light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the 
           universe has an even temperature.
        </span>
        <span class="second graphic-desc">
          <strong>NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong>  
          The universe is not old enough for light to have traveled the vast 
          distance from one side of the universe to the other, and there has 
          not been enough time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix 
          into an even temperature.
        </span>
        <span class="third graphic-desc">
          <strong>DISTANT COFFEE</strong>
          At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look a mile in one 
          direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you 
          can estimate its temperature and how much it has cooled.
        </span>
        <span class="fourth graphic-desc">
          <strong>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</strong>
          Now turn around and look a mile in the other direction. You see a 
          similar coffee cup, at exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? 
          Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in every direction, you might 
          want to look for another explanation.
        </span>
        <span class="fifth graphic-desc">
          <strong>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</strong>
          There has not been enough time to carry coffee cups from place to 
          place before they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow 
          filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might 
          explain their even temperature.
        </span>
        <span class="sixth graphic-desc">
          <strong>INFLATION</strong>
          solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a trillionth
          of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the 
          speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field 
          eventually grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.
        </span>
        <span class="seventh graphic-desc">
          <strong>FLUCTUATION</strong>
          Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient fluctuations 
          in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background radiation, which 
          is energy left over from the early universe. These are gravitational 
          waves predicted by Einstein.
        </span>
        <span class="eigth graphic-desc">
          <strong>EXPANSION</strong>
          Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot expanding faster
           than light and cooling to an even temperature as it expands. That is 
           something like inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors 
           the froth and foam of the original pot.

        Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only 
        one in 10 million.<br/><br/>
  
        Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not 
        expected such a definite confirmation in his lifetime.<br/><br/>
  
        “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been 
        lucky.”<br/><br/>
  
        The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth 
        of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. 
        Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting 
        with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of 
        Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in 1979), 
        in his office last week.<br/><br/>
  
        “It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,
        ” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio 
        telescopes.<br/><br/>
  
        Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most 
        popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was 
        about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a 
        Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, <a href="#">knocked on his door 
        with a bottle of Champagne</a> to tell him the news.<br/><br/>
      </p>

      <p class="caption" >Stanford Professor Andrei Linde celebrates physics breakthrough. <span class="credit-caption">Video by StanfordUniversity</span></p>

      <p class="reading">
        Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered 
        anything. <br><br>
        
        “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a 
        delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything, but I simply 
        forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in 
        an email.<br><br>

        Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was 
        still hyperventilating. “Having news like this is the best way of 
        spoiling a vacation,” he said.<br><br>

        By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation 
        had been seen and news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture 
        of jubilation and caution.<br><br>

        Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that 
        if this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries 
        in the history of science.”<br><br>

        John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and 
        head of a competing project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced 
        himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful and very 
        convincing,” he said.<br><br>

        Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation 
        that posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis, 
        said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he 
        expressed reservations about inflation.<br><br>

        Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need 
        for confirmation, noting that the new results exceeded earlier estimates 
        based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space 
        Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.<br><br>

        “So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss 
        said.<br><br>

        Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will 
        report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are 
        trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.<br><br>

        Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the 
        cosmic microwaves, which were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias 
        and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel Prize.
        <br><br>
        Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. 
        He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of 
        increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the 
        thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are 
        Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the 
        California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.<br><br>
        
        “The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the 
        ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering 
        over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.<br><br>

        The Bicep2 telescope, in the foreground, was used to

        In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave 
        radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight preference 
        to vibrate in one direction rather than another.<br><br>

        This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational 
        waves from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and 
        stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of 
        polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the 
        polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.<br><br>
        
        Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small 
        differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, 
        Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.<br><br>
        
        “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.<br><br>
        
        The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent 
        a year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had 
        things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the 
        breakthrough.<br><br>

        A Special Time
      </h2>

      <p class="reading"> 
        The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like 
        Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected 
        was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.<br><br>

        Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, 
        electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long 
        suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a single 
        unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
        <br><br>
        As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from 
        grace, like some old folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with 
        each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another 
        splitting away.<br><br>

        That was where Dr. Guth came in.<br><br>

        Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the 
        temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is disturbed, at which 
        point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.<br><br>

        Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state 
        too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a 
        mysterious latent energy.<br><br>

        Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a 
        kind of antigravity, and the universe would blow itself up. Since it 
        was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space was 
        created, the harder it pushed apart.<br><br>

        What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a 
        trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of primordial 
        energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
        <br><br>
        Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary 
        particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was still ahead, 
        resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars 
        billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such 
        thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might 
        be the ultimate free lunch.”<br><br>

        Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from 
        Dr. Guth’s original vision suggest that inflation, once started, 
        is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable homey 
        expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning 
        off other bubbles endlessly, a concept known as the multiverse.<br><br>

        So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not 
        bother asking about going any deeper into the past.<br><br>

        We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very 
        beginning, because inflation erases everything that came before it. 
        All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away, 
        forever out of our view.<br><br>

        “If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a 
        Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part of the team, 
        “you wind up at inflation.”<br><br>
